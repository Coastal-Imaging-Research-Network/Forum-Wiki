## Steps to INITIALLY checkout, change, and push changes to CIRN Github

# Go to the location on your local machine where you want to put the repository
$ cd your/development/folder

# Clone the most updated repository to your local machine
$ git clone https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/cBathy-Toolbox.git 
OR 
$ git clone https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/UAV-Processing-Toolbox.git 

## CHOOSE OPTION (A) or (B) depending on your goal: 

# (A) Checkout the master for a most recent release to run the code
$ git checkout master 
# run code as you’d like

# (B) Checkout the Development branch to add your features or make edits to existing development code 
$ git checkout development 

# Make your own branch for editing
$ git branch your_branch_name
$ git checkout your_branch_name
 
# Check to make sure you’re editing your branch
$ git branch -v 

# Add files to git version control
git add new_file.txt

# commit your changes locally (to be able to come back to that point at any time)
$ git commit -a -m ’Describe your changes’

# Once you are satisfied with all your changes, PUSH your branch to the online repository
git push origin your_branch_name
 

## IF already cloned previously and made your own branch, DO THIS  

# Checkout your most recent version
$ git checkout your_branch_name
 
# Check to make sure you’re editing your branch
$ git branch -v 

# Add files to git version control
$ git add new_file.txt

# commit your changes locally (to be able to come back to that point at any time)
$ git commit -a -m ’Describe your changes’

# Once you are satisfied with all your changes, PUSH your branch to the online repository
$ git push origin your_branch_name
 
## NOW you think your changes are worthy to be merged to the development branch 
- Go to the code tab of the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/cBathy-Toolbox)
- change the working branch to your_branch_name
- click “New pull request”
- change base branch to “development”
- edit description of your changes and WHY your code should be merged
- click “create pull request” 
- wait for an admin to approve your request or request further information
