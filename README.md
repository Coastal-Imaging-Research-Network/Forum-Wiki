# Forum-Wiki

This repository is for a Forum (Issues) and Wiki for general coastal imaging topics. For code issues and changes, go to the individual code repositories at https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/


General best practice is to create a branch off of development and create a pull request 
to merge changes into devlopment branch.  Each new version will merge the development into 
the master branch (and attach a version Tag).  If you would like to develop in your own environment try forking!
